      <h2 class="yotta">Meet your new old friend!</h2>
      <article>These senior pets have come from every walk and waggle of life, from former strays going into a great retirement to old family pets that couldn't be taken care of anymore and even some who have never been outside a shelter despite being the most lovable old fellas around. Just because they may have a harder time getting around and can't hear or see like they used to doesn't mean they can't be ypur new best friend! In fact, those grey muzzles and scruffy coats mean that they've had years of experience in making people smile!</article>
